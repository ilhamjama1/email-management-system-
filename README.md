## Email Management System Application Project
  
  A Java application is designed to streamline the onboarding process for new employees by automating the creation of company email accounts. Key features are:


User-Friendly Onboarding:
New hires can input their first and last names, select a department, and the system automatically generates a company email address with a secure password.

Department Code Input:
Users are prompted to input a department code from a predefined list (Sales, Development, Accounting, or None), ensuring accurate departmental categorization.

Random Password Generation:
The system generates random passwords to enhance security. Passwords include a mix of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Mailbox Capacity Configuration:
Users have the flexibility to set their mailbox capacity, allowing customization based on individual needs.

Password Change Capability:
Employees can change their passwords, providing an extra layer of security and personalization.
File Handling for Data Persistence:

The application also supports saving and loading user data to and from a text file, ensuring that information persists across different program executions.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the Emailapp class.
Follow the on-screen prompts to input your details and experience the new hire 
onboarding process.
